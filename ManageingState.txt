Thinking about UI declaratively 

Different visual states
1. Initial setup.
2. stale
3. running
4. stale

Events which transfer from 1 state to another
1-->2 Due to submission of powers of battery and bulb.
2-->3 either total power becoming zero or total consumption becoming zero

states required 
1. isReadyToRun
2. bulb, 
3. battery
